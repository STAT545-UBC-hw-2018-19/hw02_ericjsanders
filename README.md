# STAT545 Homework 2 Repository
## Eric Sanders

Welcome! This is a repository used to store the contents of Homework Assignment 2 of *STAT545*, a course taught in the fall of 2018 at the University of British Columbia.

This repository is only contributed to by Eric Sanders, me. The main contribution to this repository besides this ReadMe is an exploration of the `Chile` data frame available for free in R in the `carData` package. This work is visible **[here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw02_ericjsanders/blob/master/hw02Exploration.md)**!

## Purpose and Use of the Data

The data set in question tracks some variables describing ~2500 residents of Chile in the time of an important public vote in 1988, including what the residents intended to respond in the vote.

In this document you will see the following sections of the data exploration:

* Loading in the Data
* Summarizing the Data
* Examining Relationships between Single Variables and Voter Outcome
* Examining a Selection of Multiple Variables at Once
* Summary Statements

## Results of Data Exploration

In the document you will also be able to see how we arrive at the following possible interpretations of our visualizations of the data:

* Income appears unrelated to voter response or to age.
* Younger and/or more educated people appear to vote 'no' more often, abstain more often, and vote 'yes' or be uncertain less often.
* Men appear to vote 'no' slightly more often and to be uncertain slightly less often.
* Age and education appear to behave independently and to not interact with each other when considering their association with voter response.
