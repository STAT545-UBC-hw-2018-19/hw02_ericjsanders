# STAT545 Homework 2 Repository
## Eric Sanders

Welcome! This is a repository used to store the contents of Homework Assignment 2 of *STAT545*, a course taught in the fall of 2018 at the University of British Columbia.

This repository is only contributed to by Eric Sanders, me. The main contribution to this repository besides this ReadMe is an exploration of the `Chile` data frame available for free in R in the `carData` package. This work is visible **[here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-ericjsanders/blob/master/hw01Exploration.md)**!
